## Project Description
* This is implementation of maddpg algorithm in **tensorflow keras** and is easy to understand
* maddpg implementation of openai is in **tensorflow v1**, hence making it difficult to understand for those who is accustomed to **tensorflow v2** and **keras**
* This is implementation is built-up on **DDPG** implementation on [Keras Website](https://keras.io/examples/rl/ddpg_pendulum/), have a look at ddpg implementation as well
* This repository is a good starting point for those looking to customize maddpg implementation

## Features
* This implementation has been succesfully tested for **competetive environment** of 2 pursuer and 1 evader problem
* This implementation works for any (**n**) number of agents, which can be decided by user
* To work with this implementation, user only needs to create a new `env.py` file, defining the environment 
* Here reward curve generated by this implementation 2 pursuer-1 evader envader after training for 3000 episodes

* Also check the small animation generated by trained model (using this implementation) for 2 pursuer-1 evader envader environment

* Impementation is very well documentated, and given easy implementation it is easy to understand
* Author of code can be contacted directly on email(**prshukla.edu@gmail.com**) or [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pr-shukla/) in case of issue
* Please note that **GPU** implementation is currently not supported, please contact author of the code if enhancement to add GPU support for training is needed
* It takes around **20 hours** to train 3 agents in 2 pursuer-1 evader environment for **3000 episodes** (100 steps in each episode) on **single i5-113G7** processor

## Installation
For successful installation, use the given commands in terminal
```
git clone https://github.com/pr-shukla/maddpg-keras.git
cd maddpg-keras
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
1. To train on the same 2 pursuer 1 evader competetive environment run the following command in root folder
```
python3 train.py
```
2. You can create custom environment in `env.py` and then repeat step 1. `env.py` file should have following class and method
```python
class Environment:
    def __init__(self):
        pass
    def initial_obs():
        '''
        Define initial observation state of your environment
        '''
    def step(self, action):
        '''
        Execute step and calculate new observation state
        '''

def reward(state):
    '''
    Calculate reward given new state
    '''
``` 
3. You may want to change values of parameter like **STD_DEV**, **GAMMA**, **TAU** in `config.py` for custom environment
4. To quickly see the result of previous training that author did, you can run `predict.py` as (trained models are saved in saved_models folder)
```
python3 predict.py
``` 

## Code Structure
* Code contains three directory: `maddpg` (contains code for maddpg implementation), `env` (contains training and prediction environment code), `saved_models` (contained pretrained models)
* `train.py`: Main trianing code
* `config.py`: Define training parameters like NUM_EPISODES, NUM_STEPS
* `predict.py`: Code for testing trained model on prediction environment
* `\maddpg\buffer.py`: 1. Calculates gradient and updates critic and actor models 2. Maintains buffer of experience
* `\maddpg\model.py`: Creates neural network model for actor and critic model
* `\maddpg\noise.py`: Creates random noise which added to predicted action for more exploration
* `\env\env.py`: Training environment is defined here
* `\env\env_predict.py`: Prediction/Testing environment is defined here
* Please refer to algorithm while going through code

## Possible Enhancements
Updates as of Dec 10, 2023
* Training on **GPU** is not supported, contribution is welcomed to make this enhancement
* Implementation has been tested for **tensorflow version 2.3 and 2.8**, recent versions may not work.
* Currently time complexity of training is *O(batch size)*, please look at implmentation in buffer.py for more details

## How to Contribute
* To make contribution simply create issue and raise pull request.

## Support
* For any support related to implementation, you can either raise an issue or could direectly shoot email at *prshukla.edu@gmail.com*
